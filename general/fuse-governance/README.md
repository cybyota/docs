# Yota Governance

Yota is already a signigicantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** Yota validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [Yota improvement proposals](https://docs.cybyotascan.com/general/fips) \(FIPs\).  Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **Yota Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the Yota treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis YOTA supply \(see the subsection "[YOTA Supply and Current Distribution](https://docs.cybyotascan.com/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)"\) are currently mostly managed by a foundation. For Yota, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company Yota Limited.

Yota Foundation employs the Yota project team whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://cybyotascan.com/about).

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators, other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on Yota. It also works on boosting the adoption of the network through improving the Yota tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.  

3\) **Yota Assembly.** See the Assembly [page](https://docs.cybyotascan.com/general/fuse-governance/fuse-assembly) for more details.
