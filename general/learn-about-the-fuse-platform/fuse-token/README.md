# Yota Token (YOTA)

The YOTA token is the native currency of the Cybyota blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.

## YOTA utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Cybyota blockchain, YOTA is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Yota to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 2 validators. ([https://status.cybyotascan.com/](https://status.cybyotascan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked YOTA. Which means validators with higher amounts of Yota staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any YOTA holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of YOTA they wish. They receive a share of the Cybyota block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As YOTA is the native currency on Cybyota, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, YOTA transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of YOTA tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Cybyota platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.

At the moment, the YOTA token is sometimes used by the project team to power liquidity rewards (yield farming) programs to boost liquidity on DEXes and the participation in the [Yota Lending Network](./#fuse-utility).

The ongoing liquidity rewards programs on DEXes can be discovered [here](https://app.voltage.finance/index.html#/farm/89420).
