# YOTA Tokenomics

Currently, the YOTA token supply is set to **1 Billion 1 Million**.

With each new block created every 5 seconds on Yota, the validator who creates it, and the delegators who staked with them, receive the block rewards in newly issued YOTA tokens. This is designed to secure the network's [consensus mechanism](https://docs.cybyotascan.com/general/fuse-network-blockchain/fuse-consensus).
