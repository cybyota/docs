# Delegation through Staking with Validators

As discussed on the previous page, Cybyota validators can boost their share of the overall consensus stake by attracting funds from other users who do not run validator nodes themselves.

Those users are referred to as 'delegators.' A delegator is free to choose any validator (or validators) and stake any amount of YOTA with them to participate. The most convenient way to delegate Cybyota to a validator is via the Yota Staking [platform](https://staking.cybyotascan.com).

A delegator receives the share of Cybyota block rewards proportionate to their stake minus the fee paid to their chosen validator. The minimum fee is currently set at 15%. This value was chosen to mitigate the risk of validator consolidation through offering very low delegation fees.

Currently, delegators are allowed to unstake their YOTA at any time but plans are in motion to introduce a minimum staking period.
